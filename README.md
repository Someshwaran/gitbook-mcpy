# Concurrency in Python

These are my study notes for multi-threaded, multi-core and async Python.

## Proposed contents

It should cover:

- Locks
- Async
- Threading
- Multiprocess

## Motivation

Reasoning about systems is hard, once they no longer execute sequentially. But, to get performance out of modern machines, we have to move to non-blocking and/or multicore software. I want to learn how to do that safely.
