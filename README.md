# Concurrency in Python

These are my study notes for multi-threaded, multi-core and async Python.

## Contents

* [Data structures](data_structures.md)
* [Non-blocking and async](async.md)
* [Threads](threads.md)
* [Processes](processes.md)
* [Common patterns](patterns.md)

## Motivation

Reasoning about systems is hard, once they no longer execute sequentially. But, to get performance out of modern machines, we have to move to non-blocking and/or multicore software. I want to learn how to do that safely.
